# üé® HTML & CSS Mini-Projects: Game of Shapes & Game of Cards

A collection of two visually engaging and interactive front-end mini-projects built exclusively with **pure HTML and CSS**. This repository demonstrates advanced CSS techniques, creative animations, and a strong focus on modern web design principles‚Äîall without a single line of JavaScript.

## üöÄ Featured Projects

### 1. Game of Shapes
An interactive art project built with CSS that challenges the user to discover and interact with hidden elements. This project is a playground for exploring the power of CSS selectors like `:hover` and `:active` to create a dynamic experience.

**‚ú® Key Features & Techniques:**
*   **Pure CSS Art:** All shapes (circles, triangles, polygons) are created using clever `border` and `clip-path` properties.
*   **CSS Animations & Transitions:** Smooth transformations, color shifts, and size changes triggered by user interaction.
*   **Psuedo-class Interactivity:** Utilizes `:hover` and `:active` to create a "seek and find" game mechanic.
*   **Modern Layout:** Built with Flexbox for perfect centering and a responsive structure.

**üîç The Challenge:** Can you trigger all the hidden animations?

### 2. Game of Cards
A sleek and modern card-based interface that showcases the power of CSS for creating UI components. This project mimics interactive cards you would see in a game or portfolio, focusing on smooth transitions and a clean design.

**‚ú® Key Features & Techniques:**
*   **CSS 3D Transforms & Perspectives:** Creates a realistic card flip effect on hover, revealing more information.
*   **Advanced Hover Effects:** Features scaling, shadow depth changes, and smooth transitions for a polished feel.
*   **Flexbox/Grid Layout:** A responsive card grid that adapts beautifully to different screen sizes.
*   **Gradient Backgrounds & Box-Shadows:** Used to create depth, modern aesthetics, and visual hierarchy without images.

**üÉè The Experience:** Hover over the cards to reveal their secrets.
